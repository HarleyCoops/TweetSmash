1. Access, research, and build a context library for the mcp server and n8n implementation of tweetsmash along with notion integration. 

2. commit this to memory: @https://www.tweetsmash.com/api-docs

3. construct this MCP server


can you add this to the instructions set as we begin to map out his workflow: 

Of course. Here is a proposed digital pipeline that translates your handwritten flowchart into a functional, automated workflow.

This pipeline automates the processing of your Twitter bookmarks from Tweetsmash by analyzing the content and routing it to the appropriate service for action.

## Proposed Automation Pipeline

This pipeline can be built using an automation platform like **n8n** (which you mentioned), Zapier, or Make.com. The logic would flow as follows:

### **Step 1: Trigger**
The workflow starts when a **new item is added to Tweetsmash**. This can be achieved by having Tweetsmash send a webhook to your automation platform or by having the platform poll Tweetsmash's API or RSS feed every few minutes.

* **Input:** The full data of the bookmarked tweet, including the text and any URLs.

### **Step 2: URL Extraction & Analysis**
The first action is to parse the tweet's text to find the primary URL. Once extracted, the pipeline will analyze the URL's domain to determine the content type.

### **Step 3: Conditional Routing (The "Router")**
Using the URL, the workflow follows a conditional path, just like in your diagram.

#### **Path A: Is it a GitHub Repo?**
* **Condition:** If the URL contains `github.com`.
* **Action:** An API call is made to the **GitHub API** to automatically create a new **Codespace** from that repository. This pre-builds a development environment for you to access later, saving you the manual setup time.

#### **Path B: Is it a YouTube Video?**
* **Condition:** If the URL contains `youtube.com` or `youtu.be`.
* **Action:** The workflow executes a two-part process:
    1.  **Transcribe:** The video's audio is sent to a transcription service (like OpenAI's Whisper API or AssemblyAI) to get a full text transcript.
    2.  **Summarize:** The resulting transcript is then fed into an AI model (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, or Gemini) with a prompt like, "Summarize the key points and action items from this text." The summary is saved as notes.

#### **Path C: Is it anything else?**
* **Condition:** If the URL is not a link to GitHub or YouTube (e.g., a blog post, news article, or simple tweet).
* **Action:** The original tweet data (text, URL, author) is forwarded to your **n8n server** via a webhook. A separate, dedicated n8n workflow then takes this data and uses the **Notion API** to create a new, properly formatted entry in your knowledge base.

## Technology Stack & Implementation

Here's a summary of the tools needed to build this pipeline:

* **Orchestration:** **n8n** (self-hosted or cloud) is ideal since you already specified it. It can handle the trigger, routing, and all API calls.
* **GitHub Path:** Requires the **GitHub API**. You'll need to generate a personal access token with permissions to create Codespaces.
* **YouTube Path:**
    * **Transcription:** An API key for a service like **OpenAI's Whisper**.
    * **Summarization:** An API key for an LLM provider like **OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, or **Google AI**.
* **Other Content Path:** Your **n8n** instance will connect directly to the **Notion API** to create database entries.

This entire process transforms your manual sorting of bookmarks into a powerful, automated system for managing knowledge and development tasks.
